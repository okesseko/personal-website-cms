# Architecture
I will listing the core modules I using in this repo and the reason of why I chose it

## Create React App
Since Create React App (CRA) has a big update from version 4 to 5.

I would like to see what is different between the two versions and how it improves the development experience

## Chakra UI
I had developed project by using Ant-design and Material-UI. 

But never try Chakra-UI before. 

So I chose it for this repo's ui library
